📌 Overview

Sign Language to Speech Translator is an AI-powered assistive application that converts hand gestures (sign language) into text and speech in real time using Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

This system helps speech and hearing-impaired individuals communicate easily with others by translating sign language into audible speech.
